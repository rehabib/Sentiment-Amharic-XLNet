This project demonstrates the use of XLNet, a transformer-based model, to perform sentiment analysis (SA) on Amharic product reviews. Amharic, as the second most spoken Semitic language globally, presents unique challenges in processing and analyzing due to its morphological richness and complex grammar. This repository aims to address those challenges by implementing a robust sentiment analysis solution tailored to Amharic.
