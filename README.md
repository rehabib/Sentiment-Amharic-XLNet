# Sentiment Analysis of Amharic Product Reviews Using XLNet

## Abstract
This research addresses sentiment analysis of Amharic product reviews using the XLNet transformer model. Amharic, a morphologically rich and complex language, poses unique challenges for natural language processing (NLP). By leveraging XLNetâ€™s attention mechanism and augmentation techniques, we achieved a notable accuracy of **98.10%**, outperforming other models like BERT.

## Key Findings
- **Model Used**: Custom XLNet model fine-tuned for Amharic sentiment analysis.
- **Accuracy Achieved**: 98.10% (XLNet) vs. 90.79% (BERT).
- **Significance**: Demonstrates the feasibility of applying transformer-based models to morphologically rich languages.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing techniques tailored to Amharic language characteristics.
- Augmentation strategies (e.g., random insertion, deletion) for dataset variability.
- Comparison of XLNet with BERT on the same dataset.
